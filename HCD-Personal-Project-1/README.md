This project was really good at helping me understand how to use flex box better and how to move pieces within it. I actually found it quite challenging to figure out how to center the main content inside the viewport but with some help from the professor was able to get it centered correctly. Overall, the project was a fun one, but one that made me realize how much I need to practice if i want to be able to code these things quickly.

If you need more in depth than just links let me know and I can try to get complete citations for each. I have never cited forums before nor have I tried to site coding sites.
