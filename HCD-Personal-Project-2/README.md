Notes: I found this project semi-difficult due to never having made an email validation before. I spent a few hours trying to understand how to make the Javascript code work for that and ended up having to reach out to the professor for help. I feel like i was able to get it looking really close to the original though there were a few css bugs that I wasnt able to figure out. Specifically, the list image items. However, i feel like i have a much better understanding of flexbox through this project and was able to figure out some issues that i had with the first personal project. Overall, I'm satisfied with the way it turned out and am excited to see what else i will create in the near future!
